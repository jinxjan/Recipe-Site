        <h3>Decription</h3>
        <p>I found this recipe while scavenging a human home for more ingredients. It looked suspicious but I decided to try it anyway.. and it was delishous. Maybe I should look more into human recipes.</p>

        <!--Ingredients-->
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>32 wonton wrappers</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded colby-monterey jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>2 to 3 teaspoons ranch salad dressing mix</li>
            <li>Whatever you want to use for finishing touches such as olives, radishes, green onions and cucumbers</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Directions-->
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Press wonton wrappers into muffin cups. Bake at 350° for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook sausage and beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. In a large bowl, combine the cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, milk, salad dressing mix and meat mixture. Spoon 2 tablespoonfuls into each wonton cup.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350° for 5-7 minutes or until heated through. Add faces with olives, radish slices, onions and pieces of cucumber peel. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
